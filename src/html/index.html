    <p class="center-text">We are a group of choral enthusiasts from Tiverton, Little Compton, Westport, Fall River, Aquidneck Island, and beyond.
      We gather to sing, promote choral music throughout our communities, and engage in community service. Since our first
      concert in December of 1980 we have been led by five wonderful directors, involved countless members, and performed
      almost 150 concerts. We hope you’ll consider joining us, whether to listen or to sing along!</p>
