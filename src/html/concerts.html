            <h3>Comfort and Joy</h3>
            <p>December 7, 2018 @ 7:30PM | St. John the Baptist Church, Westport, MA</p>
            <p>December 9, 2018 @ 3:00PM | St. Theresa’s Catholic Church, Tiverton, RI</p>
            <p>Come and enjoy a collection of Christmas music, both familiar and new! This concert will feature pieces by JS
                Bach, GF Handel, Ralph Vaughn Williams, Samuel Scheidt, and others. We will sing some familiar carols in
                unfamiliar settings and showcase a piece by a local composer, Will Ayton (former chair of the music department
                at Roger Williams University). Our accompanist, Melissa Woolverton, will be joined for this concert by a
                brass quartet. Keeping our tradition alive, we will invite the audience to join us in singing Handel’s Hallelujah
                Chorus at the conclusion of the concert. We hope you’ll be there.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Tickets:</strong> $12 in advance, $15 at the door. Tickets available from Chorus Members or may be purchased
                online, at Partner’s Village Store in Westport, or at Coastal Roasters Coffee in Tiverton.</p>
